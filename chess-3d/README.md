# Chess-3D

Welcome to the Chess-3D project! This is a modern web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with the power of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) at its core.

## Getting Started

Begin by starting the development server. Choose your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project. The page updates automatically as you modify the source files.

Modify the main page by editing `app/page.tsx` to see live changes.

## Fonts & Optimization

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for streamlined font optimization, including the use of the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family developed for Vercel.
